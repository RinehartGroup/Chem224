# Chem224: Symmetry-based Approaches to Electronic Structure and Spectroscopy

**Instructor**: Jeffrey Rinehart

## Course Description

A symmetry-based approach to the electronic structure of molecular and extended solid structures with a focus on building chemical intuition for experimentalists. The course material will cover:

- Fundamentals of point and space group symmetry
- Group theory as an organizing principle for electronic structure
- Applications of discrete and continuous symmetry for describing molecules, metals, and semiconductors
- Understanding the underlying principles of spectroscopic techniques for research applications
