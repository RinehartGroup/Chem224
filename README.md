Chem224 Symmetry-based Approaches to Electronic Structure and Spectroscopy
Instructor: Rinehart, Jeffrey  

Course Description: A symmetry-based approach to the electronic structure of molecular and extended solid structures with a focus on building chemical intuition for experimentalists.  Course material will begin with fundamentals of point and space group symmetry, group theory as an organizing principle for electronic structure, applications of discrete and continuous symmetry for describing molecules, metals, and semiconductors, and understanding the underlying principles of spectroscopic techniques so they can be applied in a research setting.
