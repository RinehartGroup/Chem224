    "\n",
    "1. Be able to form reducible representations of molecular motions in various ways:\n",
    "   1. Representation of all molecular motions\n",
    "   2. Representation of vibrations from internal coordinates\n",
    "2. Reduce the reducible representation to determine the symmetry of the irreducible representations\n",
    "   1. Identify the correct point group\n",
    "   2. Use the reduction formula to project out the irreducible representations\n",
    "   3. Determine the symmetry of:\n",
    "      1. Vibrational modes\n",
    "      2. Rotational modes\n",
    "      3. Translational modes\n",
    "   4. Use internal coordinates to \n",
    "      1. determine the symmetry of vibrational modes\n",
    "      2. represent them in a molecule by projecting out the irreducible representations onto the internal coordinates.\n",
    "   5. Use the concept of Normal Modes to understand \n",
    "      1. Coupling of molecular motions\n",
    "      2. Allowed in vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman)\n",
    "   6. Apply group theory methods to determine the symmetry of orbitals\n",
    "      1. Use the concept of SALCs to find useful linear combinations of atomic orbitals for representations\n",
    "      2. Use the concept of a partner function to determine representations of degenerate molecular orbitals that conform to the symmetry of the molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normal Modes**: A set of vibrational modes that are orthogonal to each other and are independent of each other.  The number of normal modes is equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the molecule.\n",
    "2. **Degenerate Representation**: Irreducible representations that transform in the same way under all symmetry operations of the molecule.\n",
    "      - Same character table entry and have the same eigenvalues.\n",
    "      - Basis functions will form a degenerate subspace. (i.e. they are linearly dependent)\n",
    "      - Degenerate representations are not necessarily the same as degenerate orbitals.\n",
    "3. **Vibration**: A molecular motion that does not result in a net translation or rotation of the molecule.\n",
    "4. **Internal Coordinates**: A set of coordinates that describe the position of atoms in a molecule relative to each other.  The number of internal coordinates is equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the molecule.\n",
    "5. **Rovibrational Coupling**: The coupling of rotational and vibrational motions with the same symmetry in a molecule.\n",
    "6. **Allowed Vibrational Transitions**: Transitions where the vibrational modes of the ground and excited states can form an eigenstate upon interaction with the electromagnetic field.\n",
    "   1.  For IR spectroscopy, the transition dipole moment must be nonzero.\n",
    "   2.  For Raman spectroscopy, the polarizability must be nonzero.\n",
    "7.  **SALC**: Symmetry Adapted Linear Combination.  A linear combination of atomic orbitals that transforms according to an irreducible representation of the molecule.\n",
    "8.  **Partner Function**: A function that transforms according to the same irreducible representation as a given function.  The partner function is orthogonal to the given function allowing for the construction of orthogonal linear combinations of basis fucntions that transforms according to the irreducible representation.\n",
    "9.  **Projection operator**: A matrix that projects a vector onto a subspace.  The projection operator is the identity matrix for the subspace.\n",
    "10. **Degrees of Freedom**: The number of independent ways a molecule can move.  The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of normal modes and the number of internal coordinates.\n",
    "    1.  It is equal to the number of atoms times the number of dimensions minus the number of constraints.\n",
    "        1.  In 3D, a molecule with $N$ atoms has $3N$ degrees of freedom. $3N - 6$ degrees of freedom are vibrational.\n",
    "        2.  Linear molecules have 3N-5 degrees of freedom because their rotation is not quantized about the infinite rotation axis of the molecule (i.e. they can rotate about the axis without changing the energy of the molecule). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Operator**: A function that maps a vector to another vector. \n",
    "   $$\n",

    "   - $\\hat{O}$ is the operator\n",
    "   - $\\psi$ is the input vector\n",
    "   - $\\psi'$ is the output vector\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenfunction**: A function that is unchanged by an operator except for a scalar multiple.\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "      \\hat{O} \\psi = \\lambda \\psi\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "      - $\\hat{O}$ is the operator\n",
    "      - $\\psi$ is the eigenfunction\n",
    "      - $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue\n",
    "   2. The eigenvalues of a representation are the characters of the representation.\n",
    "   3. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are the energies of the system.\n",
    "3. **Projection Operator**: A matrix that projects a vector onto a subspace.\n",

    "      P = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\psi_i \\psi_i^*\n",

    "      $$\n",
    "      P = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{i=1}^{h} \\chi_i \\chi_i^{*}\n",
