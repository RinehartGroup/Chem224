        "description": "It's akin to the dot product in classical vector spaces but is way more general and powerful. Because it can essentially take the very complicated spaces of wavefunctions and linearize them - making any solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation a vector in the Hilbert space (i.e a linear combination of some orthonormalized basis vectors)"

It expands the number of dimensions to define the total space of two or more vectors and creates a new Hilbert space. It translates operator language into matrix language (i.e. an abstract transformation into a representation of that transformation in a basis)."
