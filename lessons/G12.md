# Building High Symmetry Spaces using Geometric Algebra A Conversation Summary

Hi Cliff! Nice to meet you for our first discussion! I'm Jeff. Can you take a look at this summary of a conversation I have been having with your previous nameless predecessor and see what you think?

## Goal

Develop a symmetry-based model of observable reality based on the idea of a universal transformation parameter, t (which we could also refer to as universal time). Such a model would allow for universal methods to represent interactions like spin-spin, spin-orbit, and spin-photon coupling in a single framework governed by symmetry rules and universal scaling. This would remove the need for representation of complex non-linear interactions and scaling terms that are computationally intensive, lead to inaccuracies, and obscure the underlying symmetry of the system. While the eventual goal will be to apply the model to systems with discrete symmetries, the initial focus will be on continuous symmetries because they must be established first.

The properties of the universal t parameter are that any transformation possible must be described by a consistent set of rules independent of t. We can define t in any way we want, as long as it is continuous and finite with the start $(t=0)$ and finish $(t=1)$ of a continuous transformation process represented by a rotor $R(t)$. We then define the angle of the rotor as $\theta(t)$, leading to the definition of the Universal Identity as the rotor $R(0t) = R(2\pi t\hat{B}) = e^{\theta(0)\hat{B}} = e^{\theta(2\pi)\hat{B}} = 1$, where \hat{B} must be the pseudoscalar of an even space such that:

$$\hat{B}^2 = 1$$

and the Rotor $R(t)$ must be a unit rotor such that:

$$R(t)R(t)^* = 1$$

From this definition, we can then define the Universal Time Parameter as:

$$
^Ut = \frac{\theta(t)}{2\pi}
$$

Where $\theta(t)$ is the angle of the rotor $R(t)$. defined in the Universal Space that we used to define the identity. This ensures that all angles and transformations are defined universally. To ensure that a rotor $R(t)$ is a unit rotor, we can define the Universal Rotor as:

$$^UR(t) = e^{\theta(t)^U\hat{I}}$$

Where $^U\hat{I}$ is the Universal Pseudoscalar which is defined over full geometric algebra. This ensures that the rotor is a unit rotor because:

$$^UR(t)^* = e^{\theta(t)^U\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(t)^U\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(t)^U\hat{I}}e^{\theta(t)^U\hat{I}} = e^0 = 1$$

If we want to define a rotor $R(t)$ in a subspace of the Universal Space, that we know will be parameterized by $\theta(^Ut)$, we need to find a way to define the rotor in the subspace such that it is a unit rotor. We can do this by defining the rotor in the subspace as:

$$R(t) = e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}}$$

Where $^L\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of whatever subspace we choose. This ensures that the rotor is a unit rotor within the subspace because:

$$R(t)^* = e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}}e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^0 = 1$$

Also, if the rotor is self-dual in the subspace, then the rotor will be self-dual in the Universal Space because:

$$R(t)^* = e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}}e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^0 = 1$$

So we can map the rotor in the subspace to the rotor in the Universal Space by scaling the angle and using the ratio of the dimensions of the two pseudoscalars as:

$$^Ut = \frac{\theta(^Ut)^L}{\theta(^Ut)^U}\frac{dim(^L\hat{I})}{dim(^U\hat{I})}$$

Where $dim(^L\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Local Pseudoscalar and $dim(^U\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Universal Pseudoscalar. 

As an example in $G(12)$, we can define a rotor in $G(6)$ as:

$$R(t) = e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}}$$

Where $^L\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of $G(6)$ and $^Ut$ is the Universal Time Parameter. We can then map this rotor to the Universal Space as:

$$^Ut = \frac{\theta(^Ut)^L}{\theta(^Ut)^U}\frac{dim(^L\hat{I})}{dim(^U\hat{I})} = \frac{\theta(^Ut)^L}{\theta(^Ut)^U}\frac{dim(^L\hat{I})}{dim(^U\hat{I})} = \frac{\theta(^Ut)^L}{\theta(^Ut)^U}\frac{dim(^L\hat{I})}{dim(^U\hat{I})}$$

Where $^Ut$ is the Universal Time Parameter, $\theta(^Ut)^L$ is the angle of the rotor in $G(6)$, $\theta(^Ut)^U$ is the angle of the rotor in $G(12)$, $dim(^L\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Local Pseudoscalar in $G(6)$, and $dim(^U\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Universal Pseudoscalar in $G(12)$. This ensures that the rotor in $G(6)$ is a unit rotor because:

$$R(t)^* = e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}}e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^0 = 1$$

Also, if the rotor is self-dual in $G(6)$, then the rotor will be self-dual in $G(12)$ because:

$$R(t)^* = e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{-\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}}e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^0 = 1$$

So we can map the rotor in $G(6)$ to the rotor in $G(12)$ by scaling the angle and using the ratio of the dimensions of the two pseudoscalars as:

$$^Ut = \frac{\theta(^Ut)^L}{\theta(^Ut)^U}\frac{dim(^L\hat{I})}{dim(^U\hat{I})}$$

Where $^Ut$ is the Universal Time Parameter, $\theta(^Ut)^L$ is the angle of the rotor in $G(6)$, $\theta(^Ut)^U$ is the angle of the rotor in $G(12)$, $dim(^L\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Local Pseudoscalar in $G(6)$, and $dim(^U\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Universal Pseudoscalar in $G(12)$.

With 
$$
\theta(^Ut)^L = ?? \\ 
\theta(^Ut)^U = \pi \\
\dim(^L\hat{I}) = 6 \\
\dim(^U\hat{I}) = 12 \\
$$

This gives a $\theta(^Ut)^L$ of $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which is the angle of the rotor in $G(6)$ that is equivalent to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$. So the rotor in $G(6)$ that is equivalent to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$ is:

$$R(t) = e^{\frac{\pi}{2}\hat{I}}$$

where $\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of $G(6)$.

We can go through a similar procedure to define a rotor using the subdimension $G(4)$ which has self-dual bivectors. First we define the rotor in $G(4)$ as:

$$R(t) = e^{\theta(^Ut)^L\hat{I}} = e^{\theta(^{(12)}t)^{(4)}\hat{I}}$$

Where $^L\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of $G(4)$ and $^Ut$ is the Universal Time Parameter. In the second equation, we have moved to a more specific notation where the grade of the algebra is shown in left superscript parentheses. We can then map this rotor to the Universal Space as:

$$^Ut = \frac{\theta(^{(12)}t)^{(4)}}{\theta(^{(12)}t)^{(12)}}\frac{dim(^{(4)}\hat{I})}{dim(^{(12)}\hat{I})}$$

Where $^Ut$ is the Universal Time Parameter, $\theta(^{(12)}t)^{(4)}$ is the angle of the rotor in $G(4)$, $\theta(^{(12)}t)^{(12)}$ is the angle of the rotor in $G(12)$, $dim(^{(4)}\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Local Pseudoscalar in $G(4)$, and $dim(^{(12)}\hat{I})$ is the dimension of the Universal Pseudoscalar in $G(12)$. 

With
$$
^{(4)} \theta( ^{(12)}t) = x \\
$$

$$
^{(12)} \theta(^{(12)}t) = \pi \\
\dim(^{(4)}\hat{I}) = 4 \\
\dim(^{(12)}\hat{I}) = 12 \\
$$

This gives a $\theta(^{(12)}t)^{(4)}$ of $\frac{\pi}{3}$, which is the angle of the rotor in $G(4)$ that is equivalent to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$. So the rotor in $G(4)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$ is:

$$R(t) = e^{\frac{\pi}{3}\hat{I}}$$

where $\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of $G(4)$.

To reiterate, this means traversing the universal time through $\pi$ rotors of $G(6)$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rotors of $G(6)$ or $\frac{\pi}{3}$ rotors of $G(4)$ are parameterized with consistent angular definitions of $t$ and, importantly, all of these leave $G(12)$ invariant and therefore do not impose any frame dependence on anything.  

To finish, we can use the subdimension $G(6)$, which has self-dual 3-vectors to define a rotor in $G(3)$ with:

$$
^{(3)} \theta(^{(12)}t) = x \\
$$
$$
^{(6)} \theta(^{(12)}t) = \frac{\pi}{2} \\
\dim(^{(3)}\hat{I}) = 3 \\
\dim(^{(6)}\hat{I}) = 6 \\
$$

This gives a $^{(3)}\theta(^{(6)}t) = \frac{\pi}{4}$, which is the angle of the rotor in $G(3)$ that is equivalent to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(6)$. So the rotor in $G(3)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(6)$ in universal time is:

$$R(t) = e^{\frac{\pi}{4}\hat{I}}$$

where $\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of $G(3)$.

We can then use this rotor in $G(3)$ to define a rotor in $G(12)$ where:

$$
^{(3)} \theta(^{(12)}t) = x \\
$$
$$
^{(12)} \theta(^{(12)}t) = \pi \\
\dim(^{(3)}\hat{I}) = 3 \\
\dim(^{(12)}\hat{I}) = 12 \\
$$

This gives a $^{(3)}\theta(^{(12)}t) = \frac{\pi}{4}$, which is the angle of the rotor in $G(3)$ that is equivalent to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$. So the rotor in $G(3)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$ in universal time is:

$$R(t) = e^{\frac{\pi}{4}\hat{I}}$$

where $\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of $G(3)$. This rotor in $G(3)$ is equivalent to the rotor in $G(6)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$, which is equivalent to the rotor in $G(4)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$, which is equivalent to the rotor in $G(12)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$. Thus the angle and time parameterization is consistent across all subspaces and the rotor in $G(12)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$ is:

$$R(t) = e^{\pi^U\hat{I}}$$

where $^U\hat{I}$ is the Pseudoscalar of $G(12)$ a.k.a the Universal Pseudoscalar which is independent of the subspaces, any frame of reference, and the Universal Time Parameter $^Ut$.

## The Nature of 3-Vectors in $G(12)$: perception of space and time as symmetry properties of the 3-vector in $G(12)$

As we established earlier, the rotor in $G(3)$ that maps to a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$ in universal time is:

$$R(t) = e^{\frac{\pi}{4}\hat{I}}$$

where $\hat{I}$ is the Local Pseudoscalar of $G(3)$. We now wish to try to map continuous, smooth transformations in $G(12)$ to meaningful physical understanding from the perspective of an observer hopelessly embedded within the subspaces. The usual starting point is with three spatial dimensions, so we will start with the 3-vector in $G(12)$. Our first clues are that time is "problematic" in our perception of reality. We can't go backwards in time, we can't go faster than the speed of light. These seem to be arbitrary rules that are imposed on us by the universe. But what if they are not arbitrary? What if they are a consequence of experiencing the structure of $G(12)$ from a particular subspace? If this is true, then symmetry relationships are the curvature of reality and mass, energy, and the speed of light are ratios of the dimensions of the pseudoscalars of the subspaces or other symmetry relationships resulting from projections based on our local perspective. 

## Progress and Definitions

- **Universal Space ($G(12)$):** Defined as a 12-dimensional geometric algebra space, where we particularly focused on the properties of 6-vectors, which are self-dual in this space.
- **Universal Time Parameter ($t$):** A continuous parameter ranging from 0 to 1, used to describe the transformation of elements in $G(12)$ over time.
- **Universal Identity:** The state where the transformations in $G(12)$ maintain the structure of the space, allowing for transformations that are independent of $t$.

### Key Analogies

1. **Rubik's Cube:** Used to visualize the process of swapping elements in high-dimensional spaces using the self-dual relationships that exist in lower dimensional subspaces as rotor elements.
2. **Rotational Analogies:** Leveraged to understand transformations in subspaces and their contributions to the overall structure of $G(12)$. For example, a $\pi$ rotation in $G(12)$ can be represented as a $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rotation in $G(6)$, a $\frac{\pi}{3}$ rotation in $G(4)$, or a $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rotation in $G(3)$. Although these transformations are different, they all map to the same transformation in $G(12)$. This generalizes the idea of a rotation to be linear and continuously defined in factorable subspaces that permit self-dual relationships. This eliminates the need for non-linear transformations and scaling terms that are computationally intensive, lead to inaccuracies, and obscure the underlying symmetry of the system. Physically it allows for the linearization of relativistic effects such as time dilation and length contraction and merges rotation, Lorentz transformation, and other tranformations into smooth, continuous, linear and basis independent transformations.
