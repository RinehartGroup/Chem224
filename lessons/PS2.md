### Tolman Parameters and CO stretching frequencies

The Tolman Electronic Parameter, $\nu$, is a measure of the electron donating ability of a ligand.  It is defined as:

$$
\nu = \frac{1}{2\pi c}\left(\frac{f_{M-L}}{(M_MM_L)/(M_M+M_L)}\right)^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2\pi c}\left(\frac{f}{\omega}\right)^{1/2}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light, $f$ is the stretching frequency of the M-L bond, $M_x$ and $M_y$ are the atomic masses of the metal and ligand, respectively, and $\omega$ is the reduced mass of the bond.  The Tolman Electronic Parameter is a measure of the electron donating ability of a ligand.

The Tolman Cone Angle, $\theta$, is a measure of the steric bulk of a ligand.  It is defined as:

**Tolman Cone Angle:** The angle formed by the two lines drawn from the metal center to the outermost atoms of the ligand. Rotating this angle around the metal-ligand bond gives the Tolman Cone.

Below is a table of Cabonyl stretching frequencies and Phosphorous ligands that were used to test the concept of the Tolman Electronic Parameter and cone angle. The entry for $CO$ is the free $CO$ stretching frequency.  The other entries are the stretching frequencies of the $CO$ ligand in the complex used by Tolman for testing: $Ni(CO)_3L$, where $L$ was a Phosphine.  The stretching frequencies are in $cm^{-1}$. The data is from Tolman, *J. Am. Chem. Soc.* **1977** *(77)* 313.
