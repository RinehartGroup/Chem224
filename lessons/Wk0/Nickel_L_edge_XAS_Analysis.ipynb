The wide energy range (a), and the expanded and non-resonant edge jump removed (b) Ni L-edge XAS spectra for complexes 1 (green) 2 (blue), and 3 (red). The L-edge XAS for a reference Ni(I) carbonyl compound (light grey) is shown for comparison (c). The figure shows features for L_3 and L_2. These edges can be broad and sometimes feature fine structures. In terms of Spectral Theory, the sharp peaks, such as those seen for the L_3 and L_2 features, correspond to the point spectrum and involve transitions to specific, localized unoccupied states. The overall 'edges' (such as the L-edge shown here) represent transitions to a continuum of unoccupied delocalized states, which can be interpreted through the continuous spectrum of spectral theory.\n","\n","Gu, Weiwei; Wang, Hongxin; Wang, Kun, Nickel L-edge and K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy of non-innocent Ni[S <sub>2</sub> C <sub>2</sub> (CF <sub>3</sub> ) <sub>2</sub> ] <sub>2</sub> <sup>n</sup> series (n = −2, −1, 0): direct probe of nickel fractional oxidation state changes, Dalton Trans., 2014, 43, 6406-6413, DOI: 10.1039/C4DT00308J\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
