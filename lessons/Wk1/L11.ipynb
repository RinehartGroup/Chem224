    "### General Symmetry Transformation\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In general, a symmetry operation is a transformation that can be described by a matrix. Here, and in many of the simple examples we will look at early on, we define our transformation using the Cartesian coordinate system. In this system, a point in space can be described by a set of three coordinates, $x,y,z$ where each coordinate is a real number,  mathspeak: $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Another way to describe this is to use a vector, $\\vec{r}$, where $\\vec{r} = (x,y,z)$ and $\\vec{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This description is very useful for looking at the mathematical formalism of symmetry operations. For instance, we can describe the Cartesian space using the unit vectors, $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$, where $\\hat{x} = (1,0,0)$, $\\hat{y} = (0,1,0)$, and $\\hat{z} = (0,0,1)$ which is a basis set for the Cartesian space because any point in the Cartesian space can be described as a linear combination of these unit vectors. For instance, $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z}$. We can also describe the vector $\\vec{r}$ as a magnitude, $|\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ which defines the metric of the space meaning that there is a well defined meaning to the idea of distance in the space. We can also define a unit vector, $\\hat{r}$, that points in the direction of $\\vec{r}$, where $\\hat{r} = \\frac{\\vec{r}}{|\\vec{r}|}$. This means that any vector has a direction independent of its magnitude meaning it can be normalized and scaled independently (two vital properties of a basis set and an eigenspace).\n",
    "    \n",
    "  A symmetry operation is a transformation that takes a point in space and transforms it to a new point in space. The transformation is described by a matrix, $T$, that takes the coordinates of the original point and transforms them to the coordinates of the new point. The matrix is applied to the coordinates of the original point as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  T:(x,y,z) \\rightarrow (x',y',z')\n",
    "  $$ \n",
    "  \n",
    "  where $x',y',z'$ are the coordinates of the transformed point. In matrix form, \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that when we apply the transformation to a point on the mirror plane, the point is unchanged. This is a general property of symmetry operations. A point on a symmetry element is unchanged by the symmetry operation.\n",

    "## Rotational Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike mirror symmetry, rotational transformations retain the \"sense\" of the object in the space. This means that they can be either clockwise (-) or counterclockwise (+). The rotation axis is a unit vector, $\\hat{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Point Group symmetry uses rotation axes as the primary means to classify groups meaning the highest n rotation axis is the primary axis of symmetry whereby other symmetry elements are defined. Sometimes this axis will be $C_1$.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Rotoreflection Transformations (Improper Rotations):\n",

    "Rotoreflections are a combination of a rotation and a reflection. They are represented by the matrix product of the rotation and the reflection.

    "\n",
    "We can extend the matrix representation of a rotoreflection to any power of $S_n^x$ by using the matrix representation of the composite transformation and taking the matrix power just as we did for the rotation. For instance, the matrix representation of $S_4^2$ is:\n",
