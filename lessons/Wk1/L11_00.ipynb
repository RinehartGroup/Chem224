    "   - *Point group* - A set of symmetry operations that can be performed that leave some object in an indistinguishable state. Point groups are groups that represent symmetries with respect to a point in space, where the space is a basis compatible with Cartesian space. *crystallogrpahic point group* a *point group* that is compatible with the lattice of a (usually 2D or 3D) crystal which further restricts the number of groups to  32 crystallographic point groups in 3D and 10 crystallographic point groups in 2D. \n",
    "   - *Symmetry operation* - A transformation that results in an indistinguishable state. \n",

    "Example: Say we have a homonuclear diatomic molecule, $H_2$. We can represent the position of the $H_2$ atoms however we want, but they should always be symmetric with respect to an axis splitting the bond between the two atoms. Let's say we name the hydrogen atoms $H_{(n)}$, $n=(1,2)$ and place them on a Cartesian coordinate system such that $H_{(1)}$ is at position $(\\sqrt 2,\\sqrt 2,0)$ and $H_{(2)}$ is at position $(-\\sqrt 2,-\\sqrt 2,0)$. This puts the molecular bond along the x-axis and the $C_2$ along the z-axis.\n",

    "### General Symmetry Transformation\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In general, a symmetry operation is a transformation that can be described by a matrix. Here, and in many of the simple examples we will look at early on, we define our transformation using the Cartesian coordinate system. In this system, a point in space can be described by a set of three coordinates, $x,y,z$ where each coordinate is a real number,  mathspeak: $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Another way to describe this is to use a vector, $\\vec{r}$, where $\\vec{r} = (x,y,z)$ and $\\vec{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This description is very useful for looking at the mathematical formalism of symmetry operations. For instance, we can describe the Cartesian space using the unit vectors, $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$, where $\\hat{x} = (1,0,0)$, $\\hat{y} = (0,1,0)$, and $\\hat{z} = (0,0,1)$ which is a basis set for the Cartesian space because any point in the Cartesian space can be described as a linear combination of these unit vectors. For instance, $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z}$. We can also describe the vector $\\vec{r}$ as a magnitude, $|\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ which defines the metric of the space meaning that there is a well defined meaning to the idea of distance in the space. We can also define a unit vector, $\\hat{r}$, that points in the direction of $\\vec{r}$, where $\\hat{r} = \\frac{\\vec{r}}{|\\vec{r}|}$. This means that any vector has a direction independent of its magnitude meaning it can be normalized and scaled independently (two vital properties of a basis set and an eigenspace).\n",
    "    \n",
    "  A symmetry operation is a transformation that takes a point in space and transforms it to a new point in space. The transformation is described by a matrix, $T$, that takes the coordinates of the original point and transforms them to the coordinates of the new point. The matrix is applied to the coordinates of the original point as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$T:(x,y,z) \\rightarrow (x',y',z')$$ where $x',y',z'$ are the coordinates of the transformed point. In matrix form, $$\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
