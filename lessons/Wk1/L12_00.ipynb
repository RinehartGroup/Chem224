    "- A character table encapsulates the essence of a group's symmetry through the traces (characters) of its irreducible representations (irreps). It is the distilled essence of a group's symmetry.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- multiplication table is symmetric, $C_2$ is Abelian (i.e commutative) \n",
    "  - Abelian Group definition:\n",
    "    -  all elements commute with each other \n",
    "    -  the inverse of each element is itself: $a^{-1} = a$ for all $a$ in the group. $a^{-1} a = a a^{-1} = E$.\n",
    "    - in the context of quantum mechanics the commutator of two operators is $[A,B] = AB - BA$. If $[A,B] = 0$, then $A$ and $B$ are said to \"commute\" and can be simultaneously diagonalized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Character Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    " & E & C_2 \\\\\n",

    "- Non-trivial Irrep: $E$ is mapped to the identity matrix, $C_2$ is mapped to the negative of the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the Irreducible Representations (irreps) of a group allows us to take any function in any basis, transform it into a representation in the space of $C_2$ and then partition it into the behavior of the irreps.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Introduction to Projection Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "- A projection operator is a linear operator $P$ such that $\\hat P^2 = \\hat P$. This means that applying the operator twice is the same as applying it once, such that $\\hat P^2 |x\\rangle = P |x\\rangle$. i.e. once projected onto a subspace, the state remains in that subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider first a general basis \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{V} = |v_1\\rangle, |v_2\\rangle, \\ldots, |v_n\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "that is natural to the problem at hand. In many cases this will be the Cartesian basis (because we think in terms of 3D structure most of the time), but it could also be the basis of atomic orbitals, or the basis of vibrational modes, or the basis of electronic states, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Basis States**: Start with a set of basis states \\( |v_i\\rangle \\).\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Apply Group Operations**: Apply each group operation \\( g \\) to each basis state \\( |v_i\\rangle \\) to get \\( g|v_i\\rangle \\).\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Find New Basis**: Collect all distinct states obtained from step 2 to form a new basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Construct Projection Operators**: Use the new basis states to construct the projection operators as outer products, like \\( P = |v_i\\rangle \\langle v_i| + |v_j\\rangle \\langle v_j| + \\ldots \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with \\( C_2 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we start with a general state \\( |v\\rangle \\) and we don't know how it transforms under \\( C_2 \\). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We apply the identity \\( E \\) and \\( C_2 \\) operations to \\( |v\\rangle \\) to get \\( E|v\\rangle = |v\\rangle \\) and \\( C_2|v\\rangle \\).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. We now have two states \\( |v\\rangle \\) and \\( C_2|v\\rangle \\). If these are linearly independent, they can form a basis for the representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The projection operator can then be written in terms of these basis states as \\( P = |v\\rangle \\langle v| + C_2|v\\rangle \\langle v|C_2^{-1} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach doesn't require knowing the characters but does assume you know how your initial basis transforms under the group operations. The projection operators are then built directly from these transformed basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this approach align with what you're asking?\n",

    "#### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a quantum system with a general basis set $$|\\chi_1\\rangle, |\\chi_2\\rangle, |\\chi_3\\rangle$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $C_2$ symmetry, let $|\\chi_1\\rangle$ be $A$ and $|\\chi_2\\rangle$ and $|\\chi_3\\rangle$ be $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $C_i$ symmetry, let $|\\chi_1\\rangle$ and $|\\chi_3\\rangle$ be $g$, and $|\\chi_2\\rangle$ be $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the projection operators for $C_2$ and $C_i$, find out how the dipole operator $\\hat{\\mu}_x = qx$ transforms in both symmetries.\n",
    "2. State the allowed transitions under $C_2$ and $C_i$ symmetries for $\\hat{\\mu}_x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to use the projection operators defined earlier for $C_2$ and $C_i$ to perform the transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should provide a comprehensive teaching example and exercise. Would you like to add or modify anything?"
