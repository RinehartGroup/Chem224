    "*Group Algebra*: the set of all linear combinations of the group elements with complex coefficients.\n",

    "### The Algebra $\\mathbb{C}[C_2]$\n",
    "\n",
    " - Group: set of elements with a binary operation\n",
    "    - In this case, the group is $C_2 = \\{ e, C_2^1 \\}$\n",
    "    - The binary operation is multiplication (also called composition). If we are using matrix representations, the binary operation is the dot (inner) product.\n",
    "    - A group does not have other operations, such as scalar multiplication or addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Algebra: the set of all linear combinations of the group elements with complex coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    " - In this case, the group algebra is $\\mathbb{C}[C_2] = \\{ a e + b C_2^1 \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{C} \\}$\n",
    " - The group algebra is a vector space, so it has operations such as scalar multiplication and addition.\n",
    " - We can use the group algebra to perform operations on representations of the group elements, but first we need to define the representations in a useful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decomposing a Group Algebra Using Projection Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the group $C_2$, the symmetry operations $\\{ e, C_2^1 \\}$ form a group but not a good basis for the group algebra $\\mathbb{C}[C_2]$. We're gonna need a better basis.\n",
    "- We can decompose the group algebra $\\mathbb{C}[C_2]$ into a direct sum of subspaces. This is called *decomposition of the group algebra*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Group Algebra $\\mathbb{C}[C_2]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements $x$ in $\\mathbb{C}[C_2]$ can be expressed as linear combinations of the group elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### Projection Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection operator $P(x)$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x) = \\frac{1}{|C_2|} \\sum_{g \\in C_2} g \\cdot x \\cdot g^{-1}\n",

    "### Finding Idempotents\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon applying the projection operator, we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to consider symmetric and antisymmetric combinations as idempotents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Symmetric: $\\frac{1}{2}(x_e + x_a)$\n",
    "2. Antisymmetric: $\\frac{1}{2}(x_e - x_a)$\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",

    "## Relating to Dirac Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dirac notation, projection operators can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = | \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi |\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Idempotents in this context would correspond to states $| \\psi \\rangle$ such that $P^2 = P$, or $| \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi | = | \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi |$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $C_2$, the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations could be thought of as these $| \\psi \\rangle$ states, making the corresponding projection operators idempotent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Let's consider a simple function $f$ defined on the group $C_2$, which consists of two elements $\\{ e, a \\}$. In Dirac notation, we can represent $f$ as a ket $| f \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function $f$ in Original Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "To split a function $f$ into its components $f_e$ and $f_a$ corresponding to the elements $e$ and $a$ of the group $C_2$, you would evaluate $f$ at these group elements. Essentially, $f_e$ and $f_a$ are the values of the function $f$ at the identity element $e$ and the other element $a$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say $f: C_2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ is the function defined on the group $C_2$. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f_e = f(e)$\n",
    "- $f_a = f(a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $f(g) = g^2$ for $g \\in C_2$ (where $e = 1$ and $a = -1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f_e = f(1) = 1^2 = 1$\n",
    "- $f_a = f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Matrix Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have $f_e$ and $f_a$, you can represent $f$ as a column vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "| f \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} f_e \\\\ f_a \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "| f \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how you'd go about splitting $f$ into its components $f_e$ and $f_a$ corresponding to the group elements. Would you like to explore this further?\n",
    "### Projection Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "We've identified two idempotents (symmetric and antisymmetric combinations) that correspond to projection operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Symmetric: $P_{\\text{sym}} = \\frac{1}{2} (| e \\rangle \\langle e | + | a \\rangle \\langle a |)$\n",
    "2. Antisymmetric: $P_{\\text{anti}} = \\frac{1}{2} (| e \\rangle \\langle e | - | a \\rangle \\langle a |)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the basis of $f$, we apply these projection operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Symmetric part of $f$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "| f_{\\text{sym}} \\rangle = P_{\\text{sym}} | f \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} (f_e + f_a) | e \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2} (f_e + f_a) | a \\rangle\n",

    "2. Antisymmetric part of $f$:\n",
