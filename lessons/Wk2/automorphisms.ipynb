    "A homomorphism is a map between two groups that preserves the group structure (i.e. it preserves the group operation).\n",

    "### Example of a homomorphism: The Trivial Homomorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* The trivial homomorphism from any group to the trivial group.\n",

    "f(x) = e\n",

    "\n",
    "Bijective means both one-to-one and onto. One-to-one means that a map exists from each element of the domain to a unique element of the codomain. Onto means that a map exists from each element of the codomain to an element of the domain.\n",

    "The set of all automorphisms of a group $G$ forms a group under composition of functions, called the automorphism group, $\\text{Aut}(G)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Automorphisms\n",
    "\n",
    "An automorphism is determined by where it maps the generators of the group. For example, consider a group, $G$ that is cyclic with generator $a$. Because it is cyclic, all elements other than the identity are powers of $a$ and thus generators of the group. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to define the automorphism group of $G$, we need to define all automorphism maps, $f$, such that:\n",

    "### Example: Automorphisms of a cyclic group, $C_3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G$ be the cyclic group, $C_3$:\n",
    "  - The group has generators $C_3^1$ and $C_3^{-1}$\n",
    "    - $C_3^1$ is a rotation by $\\theta = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3}$ \n",
    "    - $C_3^{-1}$ is a rotation by $\\theta = -\\frac{2 \\pi}{3}$.\n",
    "  - $G = \\{C_3^0 = E, \\quad C_3^1, \\quad C_3^2 = C_3^{-1} \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The automorphisms of $G$ are then the maps $f$ for each generator of $G$ to a permutation of the generators of $G$. Thus there will be two unique automorphisms of $G$, $f_1$ and $f_2$.\n",
    "  - Both automorphisms provide a map, $\\phi: C_3 \\rightarrow C_3$\n",
    "  - We can define $f_1$ as:\n",
    "    - $f_1(C_3^0) = C_3^0, \\quad f_1(C_3^1) = C_3^1, \\quad f_1(C_3^2) = C_3^2$\n",
    "      - This map is called the identity automorphism\n",
    "      - We know this automorphism exists because the automorphisms form a group, and all groups have an identity operation.\n",
    "  - By process of elimination, $f_2$ would have to be the map:\n",
    "    - $f_2(C_3^0) = C_3^0, \\quad f_2(C_3^1) = C_3^2, \\quad f_2(C_3^2) = C_3^1$\n",
    " \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Now that we have defined the automorphisms, we can define the automorphism group, $\\text{Aut}(G)$.\n",
    "    - ${Aut}(G)$ is the group of all automorphisms of $G$ under composition of functions.  \n",
    "  - For $G = C_3$, we can write this as:\n",
    "    - $\\text{Aut}(G) = \\{f_1, f_2\\} = \\{f_1 \\circ f_1 = f_1, \\quad f_1 \\circ f_2 = f_2, \\quad f_2 \\circ f_1 = f_2, \\quad f_2 \\circ f_2 = f_1\\}$ which is the group of integers modulo 2, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ a.k.a the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n",

    "    - This group is isomorphic to the group of integers modulo 2, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, since there are two automorphisms of $C_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have an automorphism, $f$,\n",
    " then the automorphism is determined by where $a$ is mapped.  If $a$ is mapped to $a$, then the automorphism is the identity automorphism.  If $a$ is mapped to $a^2$, then the automorphism is the squaring automorphism.  If $a$ is mapped to $a^{-1}$, then the automorphism is the inversion automorphism.\n",

    "A group action is a homomorphism from a group to a group of permutations of a set.  A permutation of a set is a bijective map from the set to itself.  A bijective map is a map that is both one-to-one and onto.  One-to-one means that a map exists from each element of the domain to a unique element of the codomain. Onto means that a map exists from each element of the codomain to an element of the domain.\n",
