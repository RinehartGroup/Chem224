## Octahedral Crystal Field Splitting for $Ti^{3+}$

Titanium(III) salts form the complex $Ti(H_2O)_6^{3+}$, when dissolved in water. The complex has an octahedral geometry that approximates $O_h$ symmetry. Shown below is the electronic absorption spectrum of $Ti(H_2O)_6^{3+}$ in water. The spectrum is dominated by a single band at approximately 20,000 cm$^{-1}$.
