        "description": "It's akin to the dot product in classical vector spaces but is way more general and powerful. Because it can essentially take the very complicated spaces of wavefunctions and linearize them - making any solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation a vector in the Hilbert space (i.e a linear combination of some orthonormalized basis vectors)"
