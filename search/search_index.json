The spherical harmonics are a complete orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions. Thus, according to the spectral theorem for Hilbert spaces, the spherical harmonics form a complete set of eigenfunctions for the Hamiltonian operator. Many families of functions can be used as a basis for the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions, but the spherical harmonics are particularly useful because they are eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator so we can use them to describe atomic orbitals.

Here, and in many of the simple examples we will look at early on, we define our transformation using the Cartesian coordinate system. In this system, a point in space can be described by a set of three coordinates, $x,y,z$ where each coordinate is a real number,  mathspeak: $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

For instance, we can describe the Cartesian space using the unit vectors, $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$, where $\\hat{x} = (1,0,0)$, $\\hat{y} = (0,1,0)$, and $\\hat{z} = (0,0,1)$ which is a basis set for the Cartesian space because any point in the Cartesian space can be described as a linear combination of these unit vectors. For instance, $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z}$. We can also describe the vector $\\vec{r}$ as a magnitude, $|\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ which defines the metric of the space meaning that there is a well defined meaning to the idea of distance in the space. We can also define a unit vector, $\\hat{r}$, that points in the direction of $\\vec{r}$, where $\\hat{r} = \\frac{\\vec{r}}{|\\vec{r}|}$.
